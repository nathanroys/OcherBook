make CDK work
    make controller less hardcoded
        run:
            how to pass relevant state to activities?
            is this just a bunch of state on the controller?
            so controller doesn't set stuff on renderer... etc...
            in fact, CdkRender is only for CdkRead, not in CdkController

            // TODO Pass a Layout object, not a raw buffer pointer
            m_renderer->set(*selected->m_layout.get());
        is there still a generic Activity?
            so maybe onAttached / onDetached is okay...
        call cdklibrary/fdlibrary
keys for fd
remove evtKey, OcherKeyEvent, OcherMouseEvent
    - just code it natively
    - lots of dead cdk code in fdread ??
Lift navigation out of read class


OCHER-1
- Further refactor layout
  - Layout::unlock returns a buffer;
  - ~Layout deletes strings referenced by byte buffer
  - ==> should be an object
  - change what gets passed to render
    maybe
        - set the EBook on the render
        - ebook holds a Layout object on the heap
        - more smarts in layout (already laid out?)
